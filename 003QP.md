--- Q2: Display highest and lowest salary --- 

drop table if exists employee;

select * from employee;


Solution :

WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_rank,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary ASC) AS lowest_rank
    FROM
        employee
)
SELECT *
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE highest_rank = 1 OR lowest_rank = 1
ORDER BY dept, salary;



Question:
Retrieve a list of employees with the highest and lowest salaries within each department.
If there are multiple employees with the maximum or minimum salary in a department, include
all of them in the result set. Ensure the output is ordered first by department and then by
salary in ascending order. Utilize the employee table with columns such as employee_id, name,
dept, and salary.

WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_rank,
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary ASC) AS lowest_rank
    FROM
        employee
)
SELECT *
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE highest_rank = 1 OR lowest_rank = 1
ORDER BY dept, salary;
