# Top 10 SQL Query

## Query 5

```sql
-- Question:
The travel_items table contains information about travel items, including an identifier (id),
item name (item_name), and the total count of each item (total_count). You are required to ungroup
the data based on the total count, where the id and item_name columns will be repeated as per the
count times. Write a query to achieve this ungrouping of data.

-- Query 5 --

-- ===================================================================================== --

-- Drop table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS travel_items;

-- Create the travel_items table
CREATE TABLE travel_items (
    id int,
    item_name varchar(50),
    total_count int
);

-- Insert data into the travel_items table
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (1, 'Water Bottle', 2);
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (2, 'Tent', 1);
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (3, 'Apple', 4);
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (4, 'Sleeping Bag', 2);
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (5, 'Flashlight', 3);
INSERT INTO travel_items VALUES (6, 'Granola Bars', 5);

-- Display the data in the travel_items table
SELECT * FROM travel_items;



Solution: 

-- generate_series(start, stop, step)
-- 1. start: The starting value of the series.
-- 2. stop: The ending value of the series.
-- 3. step: The step size between each value in the series.
-- This function is often used in conjunction with other SQL operations to create sequences or
-- ranges of values. 
-- It is s commonly employed to generate rows of data based on some criteria. For example, in
-- the previous examples, we used generate_series to create a series of numbers representing the
-- count of items in the travel_items table.

-- Generate Series(row) based on count
select *
from travel_items,
generate_series(1, total_count) as s;

-- Printing
select id, item_name
from travel_items,
generate_series(1, total_count) as s;

-- Storing in another table
CREATE TABLE ungrouped_travel_items AS
select id, item_name
from travel_items,
generate_series(1, total_count) as s;

select *
from ungrouped_travel_items
```
