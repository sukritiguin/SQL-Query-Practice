## Query 4

```sql
--- Q4 : Convert the given input to expected output --- 
Question:
The src_dest_distance table contains distance information between source and destination cities.
However, there are duplicate entries for distances between the same cities, with the source and
destination swapped. Write a query to remove these duplicate entries, considering the distances
to be bidirectional. Ensure the result contains unique combinations of source and destination
cities with their respective distances.


-- Drop table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS src_dest_distance;

-- Create the src_dest_distance table
CREATE TABLE src_dest_distance (
    source varchar(20),
    destination varchar(20),
    distance int
);

-- Insert data into the src_dest_distance table
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Bangalore', 'Hyderabad', 400);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Hyderabad', 'Bangalore', 400);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Mumbai', 'Delhi', 600);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Delhi', 'Mumbai', 600);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Chennai', 'Pune', 450);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Pune', 'Chennai', 450);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Kolkata', 'Ahmedabad', 300);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Ahmedabad', 'Kolkata', 300);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Jaipur', 'Lucknow', 250);
INSERT INTO src_dest_distance VALUES ('Lucknow', 'Jaipur', 250);

-- Display the data in the src_dest_distance table
SELECT * FROM src_dest_distance;


-- Taking Minimum and Maximum of source distance to get same result for both city
select *,least(source, destination) as city1,
		greatest(source, destination) as city2,
		distance
from src_dest_distance;

-- Filter out the data

with cte as(
	select least(source, destination) as city1,
			greatest(source, destination) as city2,
			distance
	from src_dest_distance
)
select city1 as source, city2 as destination, distance
from cte
group by city1, city2, distance
order by city1, city2
