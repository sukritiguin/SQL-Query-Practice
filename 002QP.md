# Top 10 SQL Query Practice

## Query 1

- ### Dataset

```sql
--- Q1: Delete duplicate data --- 

drop table if exists cars;
create table cars
(
	model_id		int primary key,
	model_name		varchar(100),
	color			varchar(100),
	brand			varchar(100)
);
insert into cars values(1,'Leaf', 'Black', 'Nissan');
insert into cars values(2,'Leaf', 'Black', 'Nissan');
insert into cars values(3,'Model S', 'Black', 'Tesla');
insert into cars values(4,'Model X', 'White', 'Tesla');
insert into cars values(5,'Ioniq 5', 'Black', 'Hyundai');
insert into cars values(6,'Ioniq 5', 'Black', 'Hyundai');
insert into cars values(7,'Ioniq 6', 'White', 'Hyundai');

select * from cars;
```

- ### Q. Delete Duplicate Data
- ### Solution
```sql
Solution 1:

delete from cars
where model_id not in(
	select min(model_id) as model_id
	from cars
	group by model_name, color, brand
);

select * from cars;


Solution 2:

-- In PostgreSQL, ctid stands for "tuple ID," and it is a system column that represents the physical location of a row within a table. The ctid is a combination of two numbers: block number and index within the block. It is used as a unique identifier for a specific row in a table.
-- The ctid is often used in scenarios where you need a quick and direct way to reference a specific row, especially in the context of updates or deletes. However, it's important to note that the ctid is not a stable identifier for a row over time. If a row is updated or if a VACUUM operation is performed on the table, the ctid for that row may change.
-- Here's an example of a ctid value: (block_number, index_within_block). For instance, (0, 1) would mean the first row in the first block of the table.
-- While the ctid can be useful in certain situations, it's generally recommended to use primary keys or other stable identifiers if you need a reliable way to reference rows in PostgreSQL, as the ctid may change under certain circumstances.


-- Finding Duplicate first

select model_name, color, brand
from cars
group by model_name, color, brand
having count(1)>1

-- Remove the duplicates

delete from cars
where ctid in (
	select max(ctid)
	from cars
	group by model_name, color, brand
	having count(1)>1
)


Solution 3:


-- Calculating the row number using window function using the group of model_name, color and brand
select *,
		row_number() over(partition by model_name, color, brand order by model_name, color, brand) as rowno
from cars

-- Get the duplicate cars

select *
from (
	select *,
		row_number() over(partition by model_name, color, brand order by model_name, color, brand) as rowno
	from cars
) c
where c.rowno >1


-- Remove the duplicates

delete from cars
where model_id in (

	select model_id
	from (
		select *,
			row_number() over(partition by model_name, color, brand order by model_name, color, brand) as rowno
		from cars
	) c
	where c.rowno >1
)
```
