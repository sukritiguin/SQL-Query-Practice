## Query 3

```sql

Given the car_travels table containing cumulative distances for different cars on specific days,
write a query to find the actual distance traveled on each day for each car. The actual distance
is calculated by subtracting the previous day's cumulative distance from the current day's
cumulative distance within the same car. Ensure the result includes the columns for cars, days,
and the calculated actual distance.


-- Drop table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS car_travels;

-- Create the car_travels table
CREATE TABLE car_travels (
    cars varchar(40),
    days varchar(10),
    cumulative_distance int
);

-- Insert data into the car_travels table
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car1', 'Day1', 50);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car1', 'Day2', 100);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car1', 'Day3', 200);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car2', 'Day1', 0);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car3', 'Day1', 0);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car3', 'Day2', 50);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car3', 'Day3', 50);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car3', 'Day4', 100);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car2', 'Day2', 30);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car2', 'Day3', 50);
INSERT INTO car_travels VALUES ('Car2', 'Day4', 100);

-- Display the data in the car_travels table
SELECT * FROM car_travels;

Solution:

with previousDayCarTraverls as
	(SELECT cars, days, cumulative_distance,
		lag(cumulative_distance, 1, 0) over(partition by cars order by days) as previous_day
	FROM car_travels
	order by cars,days)
select cars, days, cumulative_distance, (cumulative_distance-previous_day) as actual_distance
from previousDayCarTraverls
order by cars, days;
