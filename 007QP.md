```sql
--- Q6 : IPL Matches --- 

Question:
In the context of IPL matches, you have a table named teams containing information about different
teams participating in the tournament. Write a SQL query to generate pairs of teams such that each
team plays against every other team exactly once.

drop table if exists teams;
create table teams
    (
        team_code       varchar(10),
        team_name       varchar(40)
    );

insert into teams values ('RCB', 'Royal Challengers Bangalore');
insert into teams values ('MI', 'Mumbai Indians');
insert into teams values ('CSK', 'Chennai Super Kings');
insert into teams values ('DC', 'Delhi Capitals');
insert into teams values ('RR', 'Rajasthan Royals');
insert into teams values ('SRH', 'Sunrisers Hyderbad');
insert into teams values ('PBKS', 'Punjab Kings');
insert into teams values ('KKR', 'Kolkata Knight Riders');
insert into teams values ('GT', 'Gujarat Titans');
insert into teams values ('LSG', 'Lucknow Super Giants');


select * from teams;


Solution:


with rankedTeams as
(select *, row_number() over(partition by 1 order by 1) as rn
from teams)
select t1.team_name, t2.team_name
from rankedTeams t1
join rankedTeams t2 on t1.rn<t2.rn;
```
